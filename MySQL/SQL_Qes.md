## SQL Interview Questions With Answers 

#### â¿¡ How to find duplicates in a table?  
```sql
SELECT column_name, COUNT(*)  
FROM table_name  
GROUP BY column_name  
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```
âœ… This groups rows by the column and returns only those with more than one occurrence.

#### â¿¢ How to delete duplicates from a table?  
Assuming thereâ€™s no primary key:  
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE rowid NOT IN (
  SELECT MIN(rowid)
  FROM table_name
  GROUP BY column_name
);
```
âœ… Keeps the first occurrence and deletes the rest based on rowid (use CTE + ROW_NUMBER() for other DBs).

#### â¿£ Difference between UNION and UNION ALL  
- UNION removes duplicates, but is slower.  
- UNION ALL keeps duplicates and is faster.

#### â¿¤ Difference between RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), and DENSE_RANK()  
All are window functions used for ranking.  
- ROW_NUMBER() â€“ unique sequential number  
- RANK() â€“ same rank for ties, skips next number  
- DENSE_RANK() â€“ same rank for ties, no skips  
```sql
SELECT *, 
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC),
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC),
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC)
FROM employees;
```

#### â¿¥ How to find records in one table that aren't in another?  
Option 1 â€“ `NOT IN`:  
```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM table2);
```
  
Option 2 â€“ `LEFT JOIN`:  
```sql
SELECT t1.*
FROM table1 t1
LEFT JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
WHERE t2.id IS NULL;
```

#### â¿¦ How to find the second highest salary in each department?  
```sql
SELECT department, salary
FROM (
  SELECT department, salary,
         DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) as rank
  FROM employees
) ranked
WHERE rank = 2;
```

#### â¿§ How to find employees with salary higher than their manager's?  
```sql
SELECT e.name
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.id
WHERE e.salary > m.salary;
```

#### â¿¨ Difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN  
- INNER JOIN returns only matched rows.  
- LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table and NULLs for unmatched right rows.

#### â¿© Update a table and swap gender values  
```sql
UPDATE employees
SET gender = CASE 
               WHEN gender = 'Male' THEN 'Female'
               WHEN gender = 'Female' THEN 'Male'
             END;
```
